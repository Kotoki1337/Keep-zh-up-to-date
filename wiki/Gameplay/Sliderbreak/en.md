# Sliderbreak

In [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!), a **sliderbreak** refers to losing combo by not collecting a [slider tick](/wiki/Beatmapping/Slider_tick) (including the hidden one underneath the slider-start).

Sliderbreaks are often referred to as **SB** *(not to be confused with [Storyboards](/wiki/Storyboards))*.
